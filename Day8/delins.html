    <h1>Redmi Laptop</h1>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Redmi is a subsidiary company owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi. It was first announced in July 2013 as a budget smartphone line, and became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 2019 with entry-level and mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Xiaomi (formerly Mi) phones. Redmi phones use Xiaomi's MIUI user interface on top of Android. Models are divided into the entry-level Redmi, the mid-range Redmi Note, and the high-end Redmi K. The unrelated Mi A Android One series is positioned in the same market segment as Redmi devices, despite being part of the upper-range Xiaomi Mi lineup. The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that Redmi uses less expensive components, allowing lower prices while retaining good specifications. In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year, Xiaomi had a market share of 14% of the China smartphone market. Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this ranking</p>
        <h3>Mi Notebook 14 Horizon</h3>
        <p>The Mi Notebook 14 is more affordable than the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon edition, but loses some of the premium styling and specifications. It weighs 1.5kg and is under 18mm thick. You get a 14-inch full-HD anti-reflective screen, which is somewhat dull but has good viewing angles. All three variants use the same quad-core Intel Core i5-10210U processor which is based on the 'Comet Lake' architecture, and have 8GB of DDR4-2666 RAM which is soldered and not upgradeable. You can choose between a 256GB or 512GB SATA SSD, and optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 discrete GPU.</p>

        <p> The design is minimalist and there's no logo on the lid. You don't get many ports, and sadly there's no USB Type-C at all. Performance is good enough for everyday usage, but even with the discrete GPU, don't expect to play modern games. This laptop can get a bit warm when stressed but is otherwise easy to use on the go. The keyboard is adequate but the trackpad could use improvement. Battery life is also good as long as your usage isn't too heavy.</p>
        <h3>Redmibook-15</h3>
        <p>The RedmiBook 15 is Xiaomi's entry-level notebook. It comes in two variants, the Pro model that we have for review here today and an e-Learning edition, that has a slower processor.The RedmiBook 15 Pro is primarily designed for office work. It features a 15-inch 1080p display, an 11th gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 512GB NVMe SSD storage.In India, the RedmiBook 15 Pro is priced at INR 49,999, which is about $685 at the time of writing. This means it sits between the truly basic laptops on the market and the more desirable models around the $1000 mark. Let's see how well it performs. </p>
