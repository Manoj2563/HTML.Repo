    <p><b>BlackBerry</b> was a brand of smartphones and other related mobile services and devices. The line was originally developed and maintained by the <i><u>Canadian company BlackBerry Limited</u></i> (formerly known as Research In Motion, or RIM) from 1999 to 2016, after which it was licensed to various companies.Historically, BlackBerry devices used a proprietary operating system—known as BlackBerry OS—developed by BlackBerry Limited. <br>In 2013, <em>BlackBerry introduced BlackBerry 10</em>, a major revamp of the platform based on the QNX operating system.<strong>BlackBerry 10</strong>  was meant to replace the aging BlackBerry OS platform with a new system that was more in line with the user experiences of Android and iOS platforms. In 2015, BlackBerry began releasing<u>Android-based smartphones</u> , beginning with the BlackBerry Priv.BlackBerry gained market share in the mobile industry by concentrating on email. BlackBerry began to offer email service on non-BlackBerry devices, such as the Palm Treo, through the proprietary BlackBerry Connect software.<div><b>History of BlackBerry</b></div>Research in Motion (RIM), founded in Waterloo, Ontario, first developed the Inter@ctive Pager 900, announced on September 18, 1996.

    <p> <mark>The BlackBerry KEY2 LE</mark> is the latest model from the company but these words bear a slightly different meaning.<span><b> The KEY2 LE was released back in late 2018,</b> </span>and this alone could be enough of a factor to keep even the most devoted BlackBerry fans at a safe distance. Nevertheless, the phone exists and can be bought if you fancy it all that much. Let's talk specs.</p>
