    <p>Eating apples can help clean your teeth. Apples act as a toothbrush, scrubbing away plaque from teeth, and removing other food debris, when they are covered in the fibrous content of apples. The acidity in an apple helps kill off badbacteria that can cause gingivitis, or inflammation of the gums</p>
