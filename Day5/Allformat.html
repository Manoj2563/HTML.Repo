    <p>The brand once ruled the US smartphone industry, and it wasn’t until the iPhone 4 came along that BlackBerry’s real demise began. Well, the brand had a really hard time around 2010 and nearly met its maker but the boxy, business phones were far from done.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><b>BlackBerry Limited</b> (formerly Research In Motion) is a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity, that was<i> founded in 1984</i>. It originally developed the BlackBerry brand of<mark style="color: blue; background-color: rgb(199, 125, 14);"> interactive pagers, smartphones, and tablets</mark>. In 2016, it transitioned to a cybersecurity enterprise software and services company under <strong> John S. Chen</strong>. Its products are used by various <em>businesses, car manufacturers, and government agencies to prevent hacking and ransomware attacks</em> (BlackBerry Cylance, the QNX real-time operating system; BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Manager), a Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) platform).</p><hr>
    <h3>Does blackberry still make phones</h3>
    <p>In 2015, Research in Motion (RIM), the company behind the BlackBerry brand, made a significant change by releasing the BlackBerry Priv, which was the first BlackBerry phone to run on the Android operating system rather than an in-house system. Despite this shift, RIM's mobile business continued to struggle and the company had to find other ways to stay afloat and keep the BlackBerry brand alive. Sadly, the only new BlackBerry release is actually a movie about the rise and fall of the popular brand. The movie is based on the book "Losing the signal" and premiered in the US on May 11th.

       <p><u><b>BlackBerry KEY2 LE</b></u> is the latest model from the company but these words bear a<span color="blue"> slightly different meaning</span>. The KEY2 LE was released back in late 2018, and this alone could be enough of a factor to keep even the most devoted BlackBerry fans at a safe distance. Nevertheless, the phone exists and can be bought if you fancy it all that much. Let's talk specs.<br>

        <br>The BlackBerry KEY2 LE features the same 4.5-inch LCD display found on the KEY2, sporting a resolution of 1080 x 1620. Instead of the Snapdragon 660 Mobile Platform that powers the KEY2, the lower-priced model has the Snapdragon 636 chipset under the hood. The Lite version of the KEY2 carries 4GB of RAM and 32/64 gigs of internal storage.<br>

        <br> Now, these specs are surely outdated by today's standards but they're not too bad. The Snapdragon 6xx series can produce enough power for a modern smartphone experience, and 4GB of RAM isn’t too bad either (the iPhone 12 mini sports the same amount). 64GB of internal storage also matches the base storage option of Apple phones in 2021, so you can (in theory) use the BlackBerry KEY2 LE in 2021.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p> It is difficult to determine the best BlackBerry phones of 2023, as the available models are already several years old. It is unlikely that many people will be interested in purchasing a BlackBerry phone, but there may still be a small group of loyal fans of the brand. Unfortunately, with OnwardMobility's recent announcement, it seems that BlackBerry phones will remain a part of the past and may only be obtained as a nostalgic or collector's item.</p>

        <h3>BlackBerry Motion</h3>
        <img src="http://www.gadgetsboy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-30-at-4.11.49-PM.png" height="200" width="300" alt="Loading">
        <p>The BlackBerry Motion comes with a 5.5-inch Premium Anti-Scratch screen with a 1080 x 1920 resolution (FHD), which is perfectly fine even by today's standards. The Snapdragon 625 SoC is under the hood which means the Motion is equipped with an octa-core CPU and the Adreno 506 GPU. Not the fastest processor even back then, and quiet on the backfoot in 2021.</p>
